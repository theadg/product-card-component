## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used SASS as a CSS preprocessor. I have learned and used custom css variables, media queries, and nesting. I have also incorporated proper naming of CSS classes. I can conclude that the Mobile-first Workflow is much better than going from Desktop to Mobile, also it's more productive.

### Continued development

I will be focusing more on using Semantic HTML tags and properly naming CSS Classes and Variables to have a more efficient workflow and experience.
